 Machine learning to understand the housing market:
 
 Methods used:
 1. Numerical and graphical summaries of the data set
 2. Employed Logistic regression model which predicts the overall condition of a house.
 3. Carried out similar study using a different classification method.
 4. Predicting house prices using ML algorithms
 5. Performed re-sampling methods to estimate the test error associated with fitting classifiers on a set of observations.
